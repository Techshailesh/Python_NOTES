but for syntactic reasons need at least a single instruction.

#### learn this bitwise opertor.

How many hash signs (#) will be printed after the following snippet?

val = 1
while val < 10:
	print('#')
	val = val << 1



Hexadecimal numbers start with 0x, octal numbers with 0o, and binary numbers with 0b. For decimal numbers, you can just enter the value.

full_name = 'i love python so much'
print(full_name.upper()[-10])

it will make upper case but in reverse order (-10)

output: O


***Dictionaries in Python don't work with slices. You can access them by keys, but not using slicing.

***Variables can't start with digits. "and" is a keyword and can't be used as a variable name either.

*** aways focus on == , it should not be = (its wrong)

*** fun([])  is wrong

***** For comparison, Python will translate True into 1, so the comparison will be True.

***var = 1_000
print(var)

output: 1000
